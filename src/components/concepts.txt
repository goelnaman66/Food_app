Reconcillation Algorithm-

1. Also called react fiber.
2. Suppose we have res-container which has 15 cards, now let us apply a filter to filter out 5 cards,
    React will build a virtual DOM which is a representation of actual DOM. Diff Algorithm finds the difference
    between the two DOMs, and then updates the UI.


Monolith vs Micro services Architecture

1. Diferent services for different jobs--> Microservices. All these services combined together form a whole
   App. This is called separation of consoles or single responsibilty principle. This React Project is a part 
   of UI MicroService.
   How do these services interact with each other?
   -All these services are deployed on different ports, at the end all these ports can be mapped to the domain.



State Variables

useState
    // State Variables (Hooks)--> Normal JS Function, giving some utilities.
    // Local State Variable's Scope is inside the Component only.
    // Whenever a state variable changes, react re-renders this component.

useEffect
    //Takes two parameters, a callback function and a dependency array.
    // The body component renders and then the callback function of use effect will be called.
    // Load -> Render -> Api Call 
    // first static data will be loaded and then live data from fetch api

    // if no dependency array --> after every render of component
    // if empty dependency array--> only initial render
    // if not empty--> initially, after every instance of dependency update
